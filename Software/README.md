### [gilbert_driver/](gilbert_driver/)

Driver to control the Gilbert car via serial communication.

The file [`GilbertDriver.py`](gilbert_driver/GilbertDriver.py) provides a Python interface with the car's microcontroller. It is based to last year's code but largely rewritten for clarity and maintainability.
